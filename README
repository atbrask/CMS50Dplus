Contec CMS50D+ Pulse Oximeter Data Downloader
=============================================

This python script can download both live data and recorded data from a Contec 
CMS50D+ pulse oximeter into a standard CSV file for further analysis.

In live data mode the device will sample at 60 Hz. Each sample is saved to CSV 
along with the current wallclock time (in UTC). For recorded data you'll have
to provide a start time as the device doesn't provide any historic timestamps
at all. In this mode we assume a sample rate of 1 Hz.

For more details, see my blog post at http://www.atbrask.dk/?p=244
